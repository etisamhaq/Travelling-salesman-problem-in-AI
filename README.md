# Traveling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm
## Introduction
This repository contains an implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting city. The Genetic Algorithm is used as an evolutionary approach to find an optimal or near-optimal solution.

## Implementation Details
1. Genetic Algorithm
The genetic algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection. In the context of the TSP, it involves the evolution of a population of potential solutions (routes) over several generations. The key components include:

Initialization: Randomly generate an initial population of routes.
Selection: Choose individuals (routes) from the population based on their fitness (shortness of route).
Crossover: Combine pairs of routes to create new offspring.
Mutation: Introduce small random changes to routes.
Replacement: Replace the old generation with the new one.
2. TSP Problem Representation
The TSP problem is represented as a set of cities, each with a unique identifier and geographical coordinates. The goal is to find the optimal order in which to visit these cities.
